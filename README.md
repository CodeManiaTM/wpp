# W++

Inspired by the legendarily long [C++ thread](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CodeManiaTM/wpp/blob/main/cpp_thread_snippet.html) in [Wirtual](https://www.twitch.tv/wirtual)s Twitch chat,
this header file is all you need to fill your C++ code with, many, hard-to-read, [Wirtual](https://www.twitch.tv/wirtual) emojis.

Code blazingly fast with this game-changing header file for the most bleeding edge C++ code.

For the ultimate [Wirtual](https://www.twitch.tv/wirtual) & [Trackmania](https://www.trackmania.com/) KACKY experience right in VSCode (_extension coming soon_).
