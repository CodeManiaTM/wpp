# W++

Inspired by the legendarily long [C++ thread](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CodeManiaTM/wpp/blob/main/cpp_thread_snippet.html) in [Wirtual's](https://www.twitch.tv/wirtual) Twitch chat,
this header file is all you need to fill your C++ code with, many, hard-to-read, [Wirtual](https://www.twitch.tv/wirtual) emojis.

Code blazingly fast with this game-changing header file for the most bleeding edge C++ code.

For the ultimate [Wirtual](https://www.twitch.tv/wirtual) & [Trackmania](https://www.trackmania.com/) KACKY experience [right in VSCode](https://github.com/CodeManiaTM/wpp-vscode), also works on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/).

## How to use

Very simple actually, just `#include` the `wpp.hpp` file at the start of your `.cpp` file and you're good to go.

There are also a few example files to show how C++ code would look like with this.

(And in [another repo](https://github.com/CodeManiaTM/wpp-vscode) is a visual mod/hack for VSCode.)
